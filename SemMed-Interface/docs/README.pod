=head1  SemMed-Interface 

=head2 SYNOPSIS

  The SemMed-Interface is a suite of Perl modules that utilize path information
  present in the Semantic Medline Database in order to calculate the semantic
  association between two concepts in the UMLS.

=head2 INSTALL

    To install these modules run:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    This will install the modules in the standard locations. You will, 
    most probably, require root privileges to install in standard system
    directories. To install in a non-standard directory, specify a prefix
    during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage as:

      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home

    It is possible to modify other parameters during installation. The
    details of these can be found in the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    documentation. However, it is highly recommended not messing 
    around with other parameters, unless you know what you're doing.


=head2 CONTENTS

    All the modules that will be installed in the Perl system directory are
    present in the '/lib' directory tree of the package. These include the
    semantic relatedness modules -- 

      SemMed/Interface.pm
	  SemMed/Interface/CUI.pm
	  SemMed/Interface/Predicate.pm
	  SemMed/Interface/GraphTraversal.pm
	  SemMed/Interface/DataAccess.pm

    -- present in the lib/ subdirectory. All these modules, once installed
    in the Perl system directory, can be directly used by Perl programs.

    The package contains a utils/ directory that contain Perl utility 
    programs. These utilities use the modules or provide some supporting
    functionality.

      nanob2b-example.pl         -- simple example of using the module

=head2 CONFIGURATION

The SemMed-Interface requires access to the Semantic Medline Database. Please install this database onto your MySQL server and follow the set-up steps found in the INSTALL file.
